            <h1 class="headings color">My Goals For The HNG Internship</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Nesta, an international intern from Cameroon
                this year(2021) at the
                <a href="https://internship.zuri.team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ulinks">Zuri Intership</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When joining this team I definitely had a lot of goals in mind,
                I mean who wouldn't?ðŸ˜… For me, my goals where quite straight forward:
                I had to get the most out of this 8-weeks journey. <abbr title="That is">i.e.</abbr> get into the right tracks
                (Digital Marketing, UI/UX, and Frontend Developement). 
                Be optimally focused and dedicated to complete all assignments/projects which will be given(*On time).
                Even though where I live internet connectivity is quite a challenge but this couldn't stop
                me from persuing this quest for knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaining knowledge was a priority for me. But I couldn't just get knowledge
                and leave. I had to open-mindedly share the knowledge I had with my
                peers. To do this, relating with others, chating,
                sharing ideas, and even making new friends was the right thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Denzel Washington</strong> once said,
                <div><cite>Rules are there to be broken.</cite></div>
                <br>But that's definitely not what I intented to do during the course of
                this internship. Instead, my aim was to follow every single rule meticulously. I may
                be a <em>"Mumu"</em>ðŸ˜…, but rather than being evicted for misconduct,
                being present till the end was the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly I wanted to show the world that I'm qualified to be on
                the job market.

                        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

                        consists of a series of elements.
                        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content and html
                        elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading",
