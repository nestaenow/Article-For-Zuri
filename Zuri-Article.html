            <h1>Hey!</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Nesta, an international intern from Cameroon
                this year(2021) at the
                <a href="https://internship.zuri.team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zuri Intership</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                when joining this team I definitely had a lot of goals in mind,
                I mean who wouldn't?ðŸ˜… for me, my goals where quite straight forward:
                I had to get the most out of this 8-week journey. i.e get into the right tracks
                (Digital Marketing, UI/UX, and Frontend Developement)
                Be optimally focused and dedicated to complete all assignments/projects which will be given(*On time)
                Even though where I live internet connectivity is quite a challenge but this couldn't stop
                me from persuing this quest for knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaining knowledge was a priority for me. But I couldn't just get knowledge
                and leave. I had to open-mindedly share the knowledge I had with my
                peers in this quest with me. To do this, relating with others, chating,
                sharing ideas, and even making new friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's this saying which says
                <cite>Rules are there to be broken. Denzel Washington</cite>
                But that's definitely not what I intented to do during the course of
                this internship. Instead, my aim was to follow every single rule meticulously. I may
                be a <em>"Mumu"</em>ðŸ˜…, but rather than being evicted for misconduct,
                being present till the end was the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly I wanted to show the world what I'm qualified to be on
                the job market.
            </p>
