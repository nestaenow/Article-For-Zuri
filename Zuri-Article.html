        <h2>Hey!</h2>
        I'm Nesta, an international intern this year in the zuri intaernship
        when joining this team I definitely had a lot of goals in mind,
        I mean who wouldn't?ðŸ˜… for me my goals where quite straight forward:
        I had to get the most out of this 8-week journey. i.e get into the right tracks
        be optimally focused and dedicated to complete all tasks which will be given(*On time)
        Even though where I live internet connectivity is quite a challenge but this couldn't stop 
        me from abandoning such an opportuinity
